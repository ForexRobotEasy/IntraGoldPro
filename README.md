## Description
IntraGoldPro is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trading strategies for gold (XAU/USD) using the MetaTrader 5 platform. This Expert Advisor implements the 'Drop and Go' functionality, which involves placing a stop loss level 50 pips below the current price and a take profit level 100 pips above the current price.

The Expert Advisor utilizes custom functions to generate buy and sell signals based on a time-tested strategy developed from two years of detailed data. These signals are used to open buy and sell trades accordingly. It is important to note that the actual logic for generating these signals is not provided in this code and should be implemented separately.

Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. This code is provided as a sample and can work as described in the product. To find the official developer of IntraGoldPro, please refer to the MQL5 platform.

## Usage

4. In the `OnTick()` function, manage the stop loss and take profit levels automatically using the `SetStopLoss()` and `SetTakeProfit()` functions.
5. Execute the trading strategy by opening buy and sell trades using the `OrderSend()` function.
